# Camera Data Prediction

SSM Implementation for Femur Shape Prediction from Depth Camera Data of the exposed knee, segmented using a Convolutional Neural Network and converted into a point cloud

The required data for the model mesh (connectivity files,...) has to be generated running the 'model_mesh_variable_creator.py' file first.

Then, the 'camera_prediction_point_point_to_surface.py' file will be ready to be used.
